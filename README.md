# Week-1
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste. The objective is to accurately identify and categorize different types of plastic waste from images, contributing to improved waste management and recycling efforts. The model will be implemented using TensorFlow, leveraging its powerful deep learning capabilities.

A dataset of over 10,000 labeled images of plastic waste will be utilized for training and evaluation. The images will be preprocessed to ensure consistency in input size and quality, enabling the CNN to learn distinctive features effectively. Advanced data augmentation techniques will be employed to enhance model robustness and generalizability.

Key goals include achieving high classification accuracy, minimizing model overfitting, and optimizing computational performance. This project aims to support environmental sustainability by enabling automated plastic waste identification.
